        Covelong (Kovalam) is a fishing village in Chennai, India, 40 kilometres south of Chennai,
      <br> 
        on the East Coast Road en route to Mahabalipuram.
        <br>
        Covelong (Cabelon in French = Kovalam) was a port town developed in the 1720s by the Ostend 
       <br>
        Company on a place provided by the Nawab of Carnatic Saadat Ali (the port was then also known as
       <br>
        Saâ€˜adat Pattan, or Sadatpatnam, according to the name of the nawab).
        <br>
        The factory was inaugurated in 1719 by Sir Godefroid Gollet de La Merveille (a Frenchman),
         <br>
        and the building of a fort started at that time. After the closing down of the Imperial Company 
        <br>
        in 1731, the port was taken over by the French in 1746, and destroyed by the British in 1752.
<br>
        The fort built by the Belgian in Covelong during the Ostend factory times has been made today 
    <br>    
        the Taj Fisherman's Cove, a private luxury beach resort.
        <br>
        Another attraction is the ancient Catholic church on the beach, built in the 1770s.
          <br>
        There is also a Dharga & temple nearby the beach.
        <br>
        Chennai Covelong Beach is one of the few places in the East Coast where surfing takes place. 
        <br>
        There is a surf school with resort in the beach and samudra community yoga school in front of the beach.
        <br>
        Kovalam has a river mouth opening that flows almost throughout the year.
