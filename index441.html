         Thoraipakkam (Tamil: துரைப்பாக்கம்) also spelt Thuraipakkam, also known as Okkiyam Thuraipakkam 
         <br>
         or Oggiyamduraipakkam, is an area of Chennai, India. It is one of the stops on what is called as 
         <br>
         the IT expressway, on Old Mahabalipuram Road, now known as Rajiv Gandhi Salai, the first six lane
         <br>
         road in Chennai.
         <br>
         Okkiyam Thoraipakkam is on the eastern banks of the Pallikaranai marsh which has been designated 
         <br>
         as a reserve forest area and is one of the few remaining significant natural ecosystems within Chennai.
         <br>
         Thoraipakkam is 3 km in length, starting from Perungudi to its north. 
         <br>
         It is located exactly in the middle of the OMR Road (Like Sholinganallur or Navalur).
         <br>
         The Thoraipakkam Pallavaram Radial road running east to west connects the IT corridor and the GST
         <br>
         Road (Grand Southern Trunk Road) making Thoraipakkam well connected to the airport especially after
         <br>
         the opening of the flyover (ROB) at the western end of the radial road in October 2010.
         <br>
         This road plays a significant role, enabling quicker and easier movement of traffic between the 
         <br>
         major arterial roads to the south of Chennai including GST Road, Tambaram-Velachery main road and 
         <br>
         Old Mahabalipuram Road.
        <br>
        Okkiyam Thoraipakkam has experienced substantial growth over the past decade, 
        <br>
        and it serves as a residential and commercial hub for neighbourhood in the south of Chennai.
        <br>
         A number of information technology companies are based in Thoraipakkam. 
         <br>
         It has many IT Buildings and has many plants in the middle of the road.
         <br>
         Palm Trees are known to grow in here.
        <br>
         Okkiyam Thoraipakkam has pollution-related problems because a portion of the Pallikaranai marsh
         <br>
         has been converted into a dump yard and garbage including medical waste, plastics,
         <br>
         tires, are burnt.[citation needed] However, since beginning of 2009, burning has been officially 
         <br>
         banned and this has led to considerable improvement in the air quality and reduced the levels 
         <br>
         of pollution in the area. After the tsunami of 2004, affected fishermen were relocated to Kannagi
         <br>
         Nagar which is a part of Thoraipakkam.
