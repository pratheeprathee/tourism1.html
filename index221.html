         Vadapalani Murugan Temple is a graceful Hindu temple built around 125 years ago. 
         <br>
         Since the idol of Lord Muruga is the same as in Palani temple which is located in the Southern 
         <br>
         part of the state, it is known as Vadapalani Temple which means Northern Palani Temple.

        An endearing sacred place of worship, Vadapalani Murugan Temple got established at a place
     <br>   
        where the ardent devotee of Lord Murugan, Annaswamy Naikar worshipped him.
        <br>
        He had been roaming to places seeking Lord Murugan’s blessings and a cure for his long time illness.
        <br>
        A sage appeared in his dreams and guided him to search for the God in his own home.
      <br>
        Annaswamy went to worship Lord Muruga in one of the six abodes of Lord Muruga at Palani.
        <br>
        While returning home he found an inspiring image of Lord Muruga which he brought home and started 
        <br>
        offering prayers to God.
        <br>
        He built a thatched roof as a shrine dedicated to Lord Muruga which was later replaced with the striking 
        <br>
        structure that we can see today.
        <br>
        Legends state that the Annaswamy’s Arul vakku which means foretelling and healing powers pulled 
        <br>    
        several devotees to the sacred shrine. After the death of Annaswamy Naikar, Rathinaswamy Chettiar
        <br>
        took charge of the religious place of worship. It is believed that the priest also had the powers
        <br>
        of dictating the words of solutions.
        <br>
        The temple got revitalized in 1920 with the construction of the tower or the Rajagopuram and the
        <br>
        Inner Ring Road.
