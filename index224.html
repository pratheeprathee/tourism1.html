           This Temple is located four Kms on the left side after VGP Golden Beach Resort. 
           <br>
           The Presiding Deity of this Temple is Matsya Narayana Perumal who is an incarnation of Lord Vishnu.
           <br>
           This Temple is built on a land that was donated to Chinmaya Mission around 25 years ago.
           <br>
           This is a Sea Shore Temple built on the shores of Bay of Bengal. The Idols here are not within the 
           <br>
           four walls like in other Temples.
           <br>
           There is also a pebbled path way leading you from one place to the other within the Temple to give 
           <br>
           the Devotees an Accupressure Treatment. 
           <br>
           The main Idol of Lord Vishnu which is  a Matsya or Fish Avatar is carved out of a 12 feet granite
           <br>
            and it is surrounded by 108 other pillars.
            <br>
            Each of the 9 feet pillar has inscriptions drawn from Vishnu Sahasranamam and Ashtothara Sadha
            <br>
            Namavali.
            <br>
            The inscriptions are in Tamil and Sanskrit with an English translation. 
            <br>
            Lords Ganesha, Hanuman and Shiva have an Idol in the Meditation Park. 
            <br>
            All the Statues are open skywards which means there is no roofing and the entire Temple is open
            <br>
            to the vagaries of nature.
            <br>
            This Temple draws an equal number of Tourists apart from the normal Devotees since it is located
            <br>
            in a Tourist hub on ECR.
