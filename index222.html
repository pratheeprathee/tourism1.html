    <p> 
        Marundeeswarar is known so because he imparted sage Agastya on curative properties of various herbs 
        <br>
        and plants.
        <br>
        [2] Since then the Marundeeswarar temple has been a place of worship for people with diseases and
        <br>
        various problems with their health.
        <br>
        [3] It is said that sage Valmiki, who wrote Ramayana, worshiped Shiva in the temple.
        <br>
        [4] Since Valmiki was blessed here, the place was to be known as Thiruvalmikiyur, 
        <br>
        which is pronounced as 'Thiruvanmikiyur' in Tamil, the name gradually changed to Thiruvanmiyur.
        <br>
        [5] There is a place present in Thiruvanmiyur called Valmiki Nagar in his honour.
        <br>
         There is also a shrine for the sage on the Western side of the temple on what is presently called
         <br>
         the East Coast Road (ECR).
         <br>
         [5] The lingam for which Hanuman performed pooja, the lingam (Meenakshi Sundareswarar) that cured 
         <br>
         the curse of Indra, the Lingam for which Saint Bharadwaja performed pooja are present here. 
         <br>
         Markandeyar performed a penance and prayed to Shiva here, Brahma conducted a festival here for Shiva. 
         <br>
         The presiding deity is also called Palvannanathar as Kamadhenu, the sacred cow, is said to have performed 
         <br>
         oblation on the Sivalingam with her milk.
         <br>
         As per another legend, Sun and Moon perform their worship practices daily during sunset on account of
         <br>
         which the main shrine is believed to be facing west.
